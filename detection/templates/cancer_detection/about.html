                    This Cancer Detection project is an advanced application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in medical imaging. It aims to assist radiologists in the early detection and classification of cancer from medical images such as MRIs and CT scans.

                    Using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our model has been trained on a large dataset of labeled medical images to identify malignant tumors and distinguish between different types of cancer. This project demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare, particularly in enhancing the accuracy and speed of cancer diagnosis.
